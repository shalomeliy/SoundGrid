// The two headers below make the page "cross-origin isolated", which is what
// lets @huggingface/transformers' WASM backend actually use more than one
// CPU thread (it silently runs single-threaded without this — the .wasm file
// it loads is literally named ...-threaded.asyncify, but the thread pool
// needs `SharedArrayBuffer`, which browsers only expose in this mode). This
// is the real lever for v0.5.5 phase 2's CPU-only speed (09/09, after
// device:'wasm' replaced device:'auto' — see HANDOFF.md) — not a stronger
// GPU, which this project deliberately stopped using after it hung a real
// GPU driver. `credentialless`, not the stricter `require-corp`: the model
// download is a real cross-origin fetch (huggingface.co), and `require-corp`
// would block any such response that doesn't send back its own
// Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header — not something this project
// controls. `credentialless` gets the same isolation without requiring that,
// at the cost of such a fetch going out without cookies (fine — a public
// model file needs none). Not verified end to end: this container's network
// policy blocks the model host either way (see HANDOFF.md), so whether Hugging
// Face's CDN plays nicely under this mode is Shalom's machine to confirm, not
// this session's.
