"""Measure this conversation's cost, and say whether it should end.

Run at the close of every version / sub-version:

    python scripts/context_check.py

Why it exists: every turn re-reads everything written before it, so cost grows
with *conversation length*, not with task difficulty. The verdict replaces the
question "should I keep going here or start a new conversation?" — that question
should never be put to the owner, because a measurement answers it and a guess
does not.

    GREEN   start the next version in this conversation
    YELLOW  the version is closed and verified — say the conversation should end
    RED     stop; it must end now

YELLOW and RED always mean a **new conversation**, never `/clear`. Both wipe the
live context equally, so tokens are not what decides. `/clear` keeps appending to
the same transcript file, so it does **not** reset the numbers below — keep
clearing and this reads RED while the context is actually empty. One transcript
per version also keeps `--resume` and `/rewind` usable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file was moved into the repo in v0.2.9. It used to live in the global
`~/.claude/tools/`, which meant it did not exist in a remote session at all —
sessions closed versions without ever running it, and said nothing, which is
the silent skip this project forbids. It is here so it runs everywhere: Windows,
macOS (v1.0 targets a Mac build), and the Linux containers agents run in.

**The thresholds below are this repo's, calibrated on 2026-09-02**, and may not
match the ones the original global script carried. If you still have that file,
compare the four constants and keep whichever pair you trust — but keep them
*here*, in the repo, where every machine can read them.
