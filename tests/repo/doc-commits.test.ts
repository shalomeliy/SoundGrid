/**
 * The docs argue from history — "the gap was invisible (`59c5fe5`)" is how this
 * project records why an invariant exists, and a session is expected to be able
 * to run `git show` on it. A SHA that resolves to nothing turns that reasoning
 * into an assertion nobody can check.
 *
 * Only code spans are scanned, but any hex word inside one counts: the docs write
 * `git show 969f004` as often as a bare `969f004`, and the first version of this
 * test anchored the backticks to the whole span and so saw only the second. A
 * SHA in running prose, outside a span, is still unchecked — the docs do not
 * write them that way, and hex words in plain text are usually MIDI bytes.
 *
 * This is also the tail of a real failure: HANDOFF.md pinned a commit SHA in its
 * push-status line, the line aged into a false claim about the repo's state, and
 * `969f004` removed it. A SHA in the docs is a claim, and claims get checked.

/**
 * A named exclusion, not an omission: the token must contain a hex letter, so
 * `16777215` (0xFFFFFF written out in serato-formats.md) is not mistaken for a
 * commit. The cost is an all-digit abbreviation — ~4% of 7-character prefixes —
 * going unchecked. Worth it against a rule that cries wolf on every constant.
