/**
 * Settings → Privacy & Terms (v0.8.7) states that SoundGrid has no server,
 * no telemetry, and no cookies — verified 12/09 by grepping `src/` for
 * `fetch(`/`analytics`/`cookie` and finding zero hits (write-feature-spec).
 * A claim like that goes stale the moment someone adds a server call or a
 * tracking snippet without also updating the privacy page — the exact
 * silent-drift shape `CLAUDE.md`'s Broken-Access-Control note already warns
 * about for a different claim. This is that same grep, wired to fail loudly
 * instead of rotting quietly.
 *
 * `src/app/legal-content.ts` is the one named exemption — it is the page
 * *discussing* cookies/analytics/fetch, the same way `COMPANION_EXT` in
 * `platform/source-fsaccess/library.ts` is a named exemption rather than a
 * silent omission. Every other file under `src/` must stay clean.
