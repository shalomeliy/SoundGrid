/**
 * The bug these pin down was invisible in code and only appeared against the
 * hardware. `midi-check.html` on the user's DDJ-FLX4 recorded 38, 55 and 75 jog
 * messages decoding to 2394, 3465 and 4725 ticks — exactly 63 per message, every
 * message, on every wheel. A slow turn cannot produce the maximum magnitude every
 * time, so the raw bytes had to be 63 and 65: one either side of 64. The preset
 * was reading them as two's-complement, which is +63 and -63 — every tick
 * amplified 63x and pointed the wrong way.
 *
 * Both schemes are kept and both are tested, because the choice is a property of
 * the controller and the next one may well differ.
