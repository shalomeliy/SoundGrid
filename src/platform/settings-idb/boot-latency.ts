/**
 * The one setting that has to be readable before the settings store exists.
 *
 * `AudioContext` takes `latencyHint` at construction and offers no way to
 * change it afterwards, and the engine builds its context when its module is
 * first imported — long before `settings.init()` has finished asking IndexedDB
 * anything. Reading `settings.values.latency` there would always have returned
 * the default, so the field would have looked settable and never applied: a
 * control that does nothing, which is the exact failure this project forbids.
 *
 * So this value, and only this value, is mirrored into `localStorage`, which
 * answers synchronously. IndexedDB stays the source of truth; the mirror is
 * written on every change and is only ever read at construction time.
 *
 * **A second copy of a setting is a real cost** — it is the drift v0.2.5 was
 * partly written to end. It is accepted here because the platform gives no
 * alternative, and it is confined to one named key in one file so that the
 * exception stays visible instead of becoming a pattern.
