/**
 * `AnalysisCache` on `idb-keyval`, keyed by content hash (v0.4.0).
 *
 * One IndexedDB record per track, not one shared blob for all of them like
 * `genre-overrides-idb`/`settings-idb` — those hold a handful of entries
 * total, this holds one per track in the library (hundreds), and rewriting a
 * single shared blob on every analysis result would mean every `put` costs
 * O(library size). Per-key storage means one track's cache write never
 * touches another's.
 *
 * The freshness policy itself (`resolveCacheEntry`) is pure and lives in
 * `core/analysis-cache.ts` so it's unit-tested without a real IndexedDB —
 * this file is just the IO wrapper around it.
