/**
 * Bump this whenever `core/beatgrid.ts` or `analyzer-js/analyze.ts` changes
 * meaningfully enough that a previously-cached `TrackAnalysis` might no
 * longer match what analysis would produce today (e.g. a `CONFIDENCE_RATIO`
 * retuning, a bug fix in the onset envelope). A cache entry stamped with an
 * older version is treated as a miss and re-analyzed — silently keeping a
 * stale result forever is exactly the "never skip silently" failure this
 * project's central rule forbids, and there is no way to detect "the
 * analyzer changed" automatically, so this is a deliberate manual step,
 * named here rather than left implicit. See `workshop-output/PLAN.md`
 * (v0.4.0) Risk 2.
