/**
 * Crates (v0.8.1), on `idb-keyval`.
 *
 * Same shape as `track-meta-idb/store.ts`: one key holding `Record<id,
 * CrateRecord>`, a getter that never throws (a missing/blocked IndexedDB must
 * not stop the library from loading, only stop crates from showing up), a
 * setter that throws so the caller (`controls.ts`) can surface a failure
 * instead of an edit that looks saved but silently is not.
 *
 * A manual crate's `members` and a smart crate's `materialized` are both
 * `contentHash[]` — the same identity `genre-overrides`/`track-meta` use, so
 * a crate survives a track turning up in a different genre folder later.
 * `query` is stored verbatim as the exact string `core/library-search.ts`'s
 * `matchesQuery` already knows how to read; there is no new filter format.
