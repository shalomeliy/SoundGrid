/**
 * Hot-cue bank + temp cue point persistence (v0.4.0), keyed by content hash on

 *
 * One record per track on `idb-keyval`, the same per-key shape as
 * `analyze-cache-idb` and for the same reason: the library holds hundreds of
 * tracks, and a single shared blob rewritten on every cue edit would cost
 * O(library size) per write. Keyed by `contentHash`, not `Track.id` — the
 * whole point of this store (and of `analyze-cache-idb`/the genre-override
 * migration alongside it) is that a track's cues travel with the file even
 * after it moves to a different library folder, which a path-keyed store
 * cannot do (the v0.3.2 bug this fixes for cues too).
