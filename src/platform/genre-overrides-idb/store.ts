/**
 * Manual genre overrides, on `idb-keyval`.
 *
 * A small dedicated store rather than a `core/ports/persistence.ts` implementation:
 * that port's own doc comment names cue points/loops/the analysis cache as its v0.4
 * consumers, and building it out now would jump ahead of the work it was actually
 * designed for. This mirrors `settings-idb/store.ts`'s shape instead — one key, one
 * plain object, failures caught and reported to the caller rather than swallowed.
 *
 * Two stores, not one (v0.4.0): `KEY` is the original v0.3.2 shape, keyed by
 * `trackId` (a scan-relative path) — nothing writes to it anymore, but it stays
 * as the read-only source `migrate.ts` re-keys from once. `HASH_KEY` is what
 * `controls.ts`'s `setTrackGenre` writes going forward, keyed by content hash so
 * an override survives the file turning up in a different genre folder later —
 * the same identity-unification `analyze-cache-idb`/`cues-idb` use, and the
 * actual fix for the v0.3.2 file-move bug this version closes for genre too.
