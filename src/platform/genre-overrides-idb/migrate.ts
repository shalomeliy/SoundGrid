/**
 * One-time migration (v0.4.0): re-keys the v0.3.2 path-keyed genre overrides
 * under content hash, in `genre-overrides-idb/store.ts`'s new `HASH_KEY`
 * store. Non-destructive — Risk 3 in `workshop-output/PLAN.md`'s own stated
 * rollback: this only ever reads the old store, never writes or deletes it,
 * so a bad migration can be re-run (once the guard flag below is cleared)
 * without losing the original data.
 *
 * Only migrates entries whose path still matches a track in *this* scan — a
 * file that already moved before this runs has nothing here to key its old
 * override to, and stays exactly the known, accepted debt named in
 * `HANDOFF.md`'s "עריכת ז'אנר ידנית אובדת בשקט" line. What this fixes is
 * forward-looking: an override still correctly matched today survives every
 * move from here on, because it now travels by content, not path.
