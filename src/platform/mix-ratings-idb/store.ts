 * even after it moves to a different library folder.

 * "needs work", but nothing downstream reads those back — there is no
 * behaviour yet that would use a *negative* memory, and inventing storage
 * for it now would be exactly the kind of unused, unverifiable feature this
 * project avoids. Seconds are rounded before keying so a point matches
 * whichever nearby candidate `findTransitionCandidates` re-finds on a later
 * analysis, which won't reproduce the exact same float twice.
