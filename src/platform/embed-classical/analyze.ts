/**
 * The pure feature-extraction step behind `platform/embed-classical/index.ts`
 * (v0.8.5). Kept separate from the Worker wrapper so the math itself is
 * unit-tested with synthetic PCM, no Worker or IndexedDB involved — same
 * split as `analyzer-js/analyze.ts` vs `analyzer-worker/`.
 *
 * `meyda` (MIT — checked before adopting it, after `essentia.js` turned out
 * to be AGPL-3.0 and had to be reverted; see `workshop-output/PLAN.md`)
 * extracts MFCC/chroma per fixed-size frame, not per track — `Meyda.extract`
 * takes one buffer of exactly `Meyda.bufferSize` samples. A whole track is
 * many overlapping frames; this averages MFCC and chroma across all of them
 * into one fixed-length vector, the simplest defensible track-level summary
 * and the one to measure before trying anything fancier.
 *
 * Channels are downmixed into each frame in place (`mixFrame`), not by
 * flattening the whole track to mono first — `analyzer-js/analyze.ts`'s
 * `WaveformAnalysis` doc comment already measured what that costs on a long
 * stereo track (tens of MB) and avoided it for the same reason.
