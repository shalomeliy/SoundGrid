/**
 * Best-effort MIDI map for the Pioneer DDJ-FLX4.
 *
 * The FLX4 speaks MIDI (not HID) for its mapped controls. Deck 1 lives on MIDI
 * channel 0, deck 2 on channel 1; the mixer/browse section uses channel 6.
 * These note/CC numbers follow the layout Pioneer publishes for the FLX4 and
 * matches its rekordbox/Serato defaults, but firmware revisions vary — use the
 * MIDI monitor + Learn button in Settings to fix any control that misfires.
