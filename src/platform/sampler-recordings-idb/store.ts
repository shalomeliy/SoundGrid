/**
 * Raw audio for a live-recorded sampler slot (v0.7.5). `sampler-idb/store.ts`
 * only ever persisted metadata — a `contentHash` pointing at a library
 * file — because every slot used to come from one. A slot recorded live has
 * no source file to re-resolve from, so its actual bytes (a WAV blob) have
 * to live somewhere; this is that somewhere, keyed by a generated id
 * (`SamplerSlot.recordingId`) instead of a content hash.
 *
 * Never throws on read — same convention as `getSamplerBank`: a missing or
 * blocked IndexedDB must not stop the app from starting, only leave that
 * one slot unresolved with a visible notice (`controls.ts`'s
 * `resolveSamplerSlots`), never a silently empty pad.
