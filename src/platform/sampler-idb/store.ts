 * Sampler bank persistence (v0.6.0) — one record holding all 16 slots'
 * settings, not per-track like `cues-idb`/`mix-ratings-idb`: a bank is a
 * single saved setup, not something that travels with one file.
 *
 * Slots key on `contentHash`, the same identity `genre-overrides-idb`
 * migrated to and `cues-idb` already used — a scan-relative path breaks the
 * moment a file moves; a content hash does not. Restoring only ever
 * resolves against the *currently scanned* library (`controls.ts`'s
 * `resolveSamplerSlots`) — a slot whose track isn't in this session's scan
 * yet stays visibly unresolved rather than silently empty.
