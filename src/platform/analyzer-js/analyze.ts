 * put ~190MB on the heap to draw one waveform. Here the channels are averaged
 * inline, so nothing track-sized is allocated at all and the samples are walked
 * once instead of twice.
 *
 * The envelope is normalised to the track's own loudest point so the display
 * fills the panel whatever the file was mastered at — a quiet rip shouldn't
 * draw a thin line. Display gain only; the audio path never sees it.
 *
 * Bands come from two one-pole low-passes splitting at ~200Hz and ~4kHz. Cheap
 * filters are right here: this drives a colour, not a crossover.
