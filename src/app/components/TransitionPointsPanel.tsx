/**
 * Mix Assist (v0.4.6): the popover that lists this deck's own candidate
 * mix-in points, once it is loaded and paused while the other deck plays.
 * Picking a point is the flow's second and last click (ROADMAP.md v0.4.6,
 * "בחירת נקודה היא הקליק השני והאחרון") — so this panel is shown
 * automatically whenever it applies, never behind an extra open click of its
 * own. `onSelect` drives `startAutoTransition` and `saveMixEntryHotCue`
 * (v0.4.7) together — the deck's own `showTransitionPoints` eligibility
 * already retires this panel the instant the transition starts (it flips
 * `playing`), so there is no double-fire path.
 *
 * The "based on energy" wording is load-bearing, not decoration: this is an
 * RMS-envelope heuristic, never real structure detection (see the doc
 * comment on `core/structure.ts` itself), and every label here — the panel
 * title, each point's reason, the v0.4.7 proximity line — has to say so in
 * the same words.
