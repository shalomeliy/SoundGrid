/**
 * v0.5.4: automatic, non-blocking rating for the exit point a transition just
 * used — the owner's own request, right down to the wording ("worked well
 * before" for a repeat "excellent" pick, `Deck.tsx`'s `Pill`). Sits under
 * the top bar exactly where `App.tsx`'s own `notice` bar does, for the same
 * reason: a prompt the DJ has to go hunting for might as well not exist.
 * Never blocks the deck it's about — mixing continues underneath it exactly
 * as if it weren't there, and it disappears the moment any button is
 * pressed (`ctl.rateMixTransition`, which also clears the underlying state
 * so a stale prompt can't be answered twice).
