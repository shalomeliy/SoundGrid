/**
 * Prose for Settings → Privacy & Terms (v0.8.7). Kept out of `Settings.tsx`
 * on purpose: that file is generated-from-`FIELDS` UI plumbing, and this is
 * unrelated prose that would otherwise dilute it (write-feature-spec,
 * 12/09).
 *
 * The user's original request listed cookie policy, refunds, form consent,
 * analytics, third parties and reviews — none of which exist in SoundGrid
 * (no cookies, no payment, no forms that send data anywhere, no analytics,
 * no reviews; re-verify with `grep -rE "fetch\\(|analytics|cookie" src/`
 * before trusting this comment — `tests/repo/privacy-claims.test.ts` runs
 * that same grep on every `npm run check`). A page that claimed to guard
 * against them would be a false statement, not a protection. So this states
 * plainly what does not apply, the same way `COMPANION_EXT` in
 * `platform/source-fsaccess/library.ts` names what it hides instead of
 * omitting it.
