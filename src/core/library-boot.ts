/**
 * What the library shows on startup, before anyone has clicked anything.
 *
 * A browser cannot open a folder on its own — that is a deliberate security
 * boundary, not a missing API. So "load the library automatically" is really
 * two different situations, and the whole point of this module is that the app
 * can tell them apart:
 *
 * - the saved handle still holds a `granted` permission → scan with no click;
 * - it does not → **exactly one** click, and a line that says so.
 *
 * The trap this exists to close: picking "Allow this time" in Chromium's
 * dialog does **not** make the next visit `denied`. It makes it `prompt` —
 * the same value a handle has when it was never granted at all. And
 * `requestPermission()` needs transient user activation, so calling it from a
 * page-load effect raises no dialog whatsoever. Code that treats `prompt` as
 * "just ask again" therefore produces an empty library with no error, no
 * dialog and nothing on screen — the silent skip this project forbids.
 *
 * Pure on purpose: no handle, no DOM, no IndexedDB. It maps facts to a state
 * and a sentence, which is the part worth testing.
