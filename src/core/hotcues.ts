 * - `toIndex` empty: relocate — the cue takes `toIndex` and its label follows.

 * through to the ordinary seek, exactly like every other pad, rather than a
 * dead warning notice and no seek at all. `startAutoTransition`'s own other

 * Mix Assist pad), not the timestamp that gets re-appended on every save
 * regardless. A plain (never-renamed) pad has no custom text to recover, so
 * this returns `''` for it rather than its ordinal number.
 *
 * The trailing separator is optional on purpose: `renameHotCue`/
 * `saveMixEntryHotCue` both write "<text> · m:ss" today, but a pad saved by
 * an older build of `saveMixEntryHotCue` (before v0.5.3 unified the format)
 * can still be sitting in a DJ's real, already-persisted library as the
 * bare "Mix m:ss" — no middot. Stripping only the newer shape there would
 * leave the whole label, timestamp included, as "custom text"; renaming
 * that pad would then glue a second, differently-formatted timestamp onto
 * the first one. Matching either shape means both old and new data recover
 * cleanly, and there is nothing left to migrate.
