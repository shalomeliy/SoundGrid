/**
 * Three rules fixed since the v0.5.5 stub so later versions cannot quietly
 * break them: AI is **optional** (the app is fully usable with no
 * provider), **model-agnostic** (local WebGPU/WASM, BYO-key, or self-hosted
 * all satisfy this), and it reaches the app only by emitting the same kind
 * of action a button or MIDI would — it never touches the audio graph or
 * the store directly.
 *
 * Two shapes live here on purpose, for two different scenarios (see
 * `docs/architecture/directions.md` §4's scenario table):
 * - `suggest()`/`AISuggestion` — a flat, ranked, one-shot list of
 *   passive suggestions. Reserved for v0.9.5 (coaching) and v0.13.5
 *   (live co-pilot) — not used by v0.5.5.
 * - `chat()`/tool-calling — a conversational exchange that can ask for
 *   clarification instead of guessing. What v0.5.5's NL translate layer
 *   actually needs, since "unclear command -> ask, don't guess" has no
 *   slot in a flat suggestion list.
